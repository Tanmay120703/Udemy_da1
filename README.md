# Udemy Dataset Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Udemy courses to extract insights and patterns related to course pricing, popularity, and other metrics. The analysis is performed using Python and several data analysis libraries.

# Data Set
The dataset contains information about various Udemy courses, including:

Course titles

● Pricing (free or paid)

● Number of subscribers and reviews

● Content duration

● Course level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

● Subject categories

● Publishing timestamps

# Data Source
The dataset is sourced from a kaggle datasets <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/udemy-courses">Udemy Courses</a>

# Features of the Project

# Libraries Used

● Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning

● NumPy: For numerical computations

● Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization

# Key Insights Extracted

● Distribution of free vs paid courses

● Price analysis of courses across different subjects

● Popularity trends based on the number of subscribers and reviews

● Content duration trends across different course levels

# Visualizations

● The project includes various plots and graphs to represent:

Price distribution

● Number of courses by subject

● Subscriber counts by course levels

● Temporal trends in course publishing

# File Structure

● p2.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and analysis.

● udemy_courses.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.

# Results

● The analysis highlights trends in course pricing, subject popularity, and content distribution. These insights can help course creators and learners better understand the Udemy platform.

# Future Scope

● Incorporating additional datasets to explore relationships between course success and external factors

● Applying machine learning for predictive analysis on course success

● Enhancing visualizations with interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash
